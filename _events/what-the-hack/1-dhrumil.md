"What the Hack " was a one of it's kind event organised by the
Electronics Club! For the first time, we were a part of the ideation and
we decided what we wanted to make in a night out. There were many
brilliant ideas that were given like "Self filling water bucket",
"Automatic Door Lock" and so on. Each idea was allotted a mentor. Me and
my friends, who were working on Automatic Door Lock, just like others,
spent our time first on the how we could make it work. Under the
constant guidance of our mentor, Sudeep Salgia, we finally were able to
get the perfect idea of execution and and started working on our
devices. Fortunately we were able to finish just in time to enjoy the
pizzas brought for the midnight snacks with the excitement of
completion. Overall we had the best times of our lives making a device
of our own choice all by ourselves. Thanks team STAB !!
