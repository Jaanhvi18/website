What if we told you that you can build your own fully autonomous robot
from scratch, in under a week?

The Line Follower competition by Electronics Club got more than 150
freshmen to do precisely this. The idea was to build a robot that can
detect and follow a white line on a black backdrop. This not only
introduced participants to microcontroller programming, but also
provided an incredibly cool application of the same along with the
implementation of a PID algorithm. The competition gave a flavour of
control systems, and night after night of patient debugging with help
from conveners and mentors reinforced the interest in hands-on
electronics. Sharp turns, junctions, gaps in the track and surprise
elements inserted the element of challenge into the contest.
LineFollower was a fun learning experience for participants and mentors
alike!
